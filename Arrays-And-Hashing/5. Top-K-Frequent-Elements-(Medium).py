Description:
    Given an integer array nums and 
    an integer k, return the k most 
    frequent elements within the array.

    The test cases are generated such 
    that the answer is always unique.

    You may return the output in any order.
    (Allowed to utilise unstable algorithm)

Examples:
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [1,2,2,3,3,3], k = 2

    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [7,7], k = 1

        Output: [7]

            
Recommended Time & Space Complexity:
