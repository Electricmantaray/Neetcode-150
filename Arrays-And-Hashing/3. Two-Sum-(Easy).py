Description:
    Given an array of integers nums and 
    an integer target, return the indices 
    i and j such that 
    nums[i] + nums[j] == target and i != j.

    You may assume that every input has exactly 
    one pair of indices i and j that satisfy 
    the condition.

    Return the answer with the smaller index first. 

Examples:
    Example 1:
        Input: nums = [3,4,5,6], target = 7

        Output: [0,1]

    Example 2:
        Input: nums = [4,5,6], target = 10

        Output: [0,2]
